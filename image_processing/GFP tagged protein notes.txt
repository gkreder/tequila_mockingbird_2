	Binding egosterol

	Esesntial yeast steroid. Membrane integrity and potential signalling capabilities. Always present in membranes.
	Steroids increase rigidity of membranes.

	We know ampho B binds egosterol and forms ions channels (other mechanisms unkown). 

	Hypothesis 1:
		Protein SKG3 localizes to buds and bud necks (among other stuff). So we want to know buds, potentially 
		curvature of buds. 

		Hpyothesis: Binding egosterol might affect the membrane curvature (bud curvature). We have that skg3 localizes
		to the bud. We might be able to use it to find buds and get the curvatures. 

	Hypothesis 2: 
		Cell might try to upregulate egosterol (or other bound proteins, if any. Probably none). This
		might increase the size of the ER. We have SEC61 tagged which localizes to (rough?) ER. 





		

	Hypothesis 3: 
		Mitochondria are also involved in steroid biosynthesis. We could look at mitochondria size, number, 
		and morphology. IDH2 tags mitochondria 

	Hypothesis 4: 
		Nuclear size and morphology. Larger/absent nucleus may indicate apoptosis. Nuclear morphology

	Hypothesis 5: 
		Vacules (size)

	Hypothesis 6:
		Ion channels. We know they're formed. We think cell size may correlate with the number of ion channels. 

	Hypothesis 7:
		General Stress response proteins. Heat shock / general stress response. MSN2 nuclear localization.
